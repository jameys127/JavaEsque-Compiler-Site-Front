# Introduction

### Welcome to the **JavaEsque** documentation!

JavaEsque is a simple object-oriented programming language that I built using **Java** with **Javascript** as it's target language. This is a continuation of a school project where the objective of the class was to better understand how languages actually work behind the scenes and all the basic steps a compiler goes through to compile a program. The class ended before we could finish our language (it's a lot of work!), so i decided to finish it on my own time and I built this website to show it off.

### Key Features
* Objects + methods with class-based inheritance.
* Subtyping
* Checking if a variable is initialized before use
* Checking that a function return non-void always returns
* Non-S-expression-based syntax
